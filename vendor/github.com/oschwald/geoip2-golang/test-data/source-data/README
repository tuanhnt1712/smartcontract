All of these but the City and Enterprise files are JSON dumps of the databases
created by the GeoIP2 build integration tests
(TestFor::MM::Integration::GeoIP2::Build).

Additional data was added to match our legacy test databases.

The City file is of unknown origin.

The Enterprise file was a single example IP address, modified slightly to
include all fields. It now has more than that.

The Precision file was the normal Enterprise file with an additional marker
(128.101.101.101) to differentiate the two. It now contains additional
additions and changes as it is the database used in many MaxMind
integration tests.
